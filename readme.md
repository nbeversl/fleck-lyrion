# Fleck Skin Plugin for Lyrion Media Server

Fleck brings the speed, extensibility, and usability of a modern single-page app to the legacy of Logitech's beloved open source media server.

Though LMS is feature rich with many contributed extensions, it is also appealing for its **stability**.

Fleck is for users who:

- Like album art and mostly want to view their library as near as possible to a collection of discs. In track view, each track listing provides access to its full album in a single click.
- Want the option of a simple and elegant library browser with controls minimal or hidden. The many other features remain accessible through the default or any other theme desired.
- Want as few clicks/taps as possible to access library and playback

[Lyrion Music Server](https://lyrion.org/) (formerly Logitech Media Server) began as a server for Squeezebox and [Slim Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_(network_music_player)) and was made [open source](https://github.com/LMS-Community) when these devices were discontinued. It remains a widely used alternative to commercially licensed media servers.
