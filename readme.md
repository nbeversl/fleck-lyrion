# Fleck Theme for Lyrion Media Server

[Lyrion Music Server](https://lyrion.org/) (formerly Logitech Media Server) began as a server for Squeezebox devices [Slim Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_(network_music_player)) and was made [open source](https://github.com/LMS-Community) when these devices were discontinued. It remains a widely used alternative to commercially licensed media servers.

Though LMS is feature rich with many contributed extensions, it is also appealing for its **stability**.

This theme is for users who:

- Like album art and mostly want to view their library by disc. In track view, each track has direct access to its full album in a single click.
- Want the option of a simple and elegant library browser with controls minimal and hidden. The many other features remain accessible through the default or any other theme desired.
- Want as few clicks/taps as possible to access library and playback

## Features

- Remote controls all LMS players on the network
- Plays to the client device via the browser
- Search bar consolidates **all** capabilities of the LMS API for most thorough results
- Control bar can be hidden entirely for fullscreen browsing view
- Resizable album grid
- View albums by genre alphabetically or shuffled
- Random album grid on load and on a single click/tap
- Track views in search results provide access to the source album in a single click/tap
- Downloads tracks to the client device
- Light and dark modes
- CSS is not prebuilt; you can modify the styling if you want
- Optimized for small screens (mobile)
